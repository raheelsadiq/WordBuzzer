# WordBuzzer

## Work breakdown

1. Paper work
2. Test started : Inital github setup, and initial vip architecture using the template
3. Data models, Interactor flow and words read from file and a small test case for worker
4. Simple game board


## Tests
We can write test for boundry methods, boundry methods are those which are declared in the protocols. To test those methods, we'll to mock the next VIP iteration boundry methods, which is very straight forward as those are just protocols. We can use Spying to test those mocks. For demonstration purpose I did only one.


## what could be done next
Time out if no one answers.
Animation delay for win or lose for states
